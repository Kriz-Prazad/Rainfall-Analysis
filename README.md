# Rainfall-Analysis
### This project analyzes a historical weather dataset for various stations across India to understand the key patterns and drivers of rainfall. The analysis explores rainfall based on time (season, month), location (state, elevation), and relationships with other meteorological factors like temperature, air pressure, and wind speed.

#### Tools used
#### - Python, Jupyter notebook

<summary>About the Data </summary>

#### This dataset consists of daily weather and geographical data for 458 weather stations across India over a span of more than 10 years, specifically from January 1, 2015, to February 10, 2025.

#### The dataset contain 970k+ records and includes the following features, crucial for building an accurate rainfall forecasting model:

### 🌦️ **Weather and Climate Data Fields Explained**

| **Field**         | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **date_of_record** | The specific calendar date when the weather data was recorded. |
| **month**          | The month of the year corresponding to the record. Useful for seasonal analysis. |
| **season**         | The meteorological or regional season (e.g., `Winter`, `Monsoon`, `Summer`). May vary by geography. |
| **station_name**   | The name of the weather station that collected the data. |
| **state**          | The state or province where the station is location. |
| **district**       | The administrative district within the state. |
| **avg_temp**       | The average temperature recorded on that day, typically in degrees Celsius. |
| **min_temp**       | The minimum temperature observed during the day. |
| **max_temp**       | The maximum temperature observed during the day. |
| **wind_speed**     | The average wind speed, usually measured in kilometers per hour (km/h) or meters per second (m/s). |
| **air_pressure**   | Atmospheric pressure at the station, typically in hectopascals (hPa) or millibars. |
| **elevation**      | The height of the station above sea level, usually in meters. Affects temperature and pressure readings. |
| **latitude**       | Geographic coordinate specifying north-south position . |
| **longitude**      | Geographic coordinate specifying east-west position. |
| **rainfall**       | Total precipitation recorded on that day, usually in millimeters (mm). |
